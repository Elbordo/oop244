Workshop-8 part-2

I learned how to define pure virtual functions and implement them by adding virtual at the beginning of the function and 
assigning it to 0 at the end.
I learned how to create abstract classes with virtual functions and then inherit it.
I learned how to implement behavior using virtual functions by overriding the Shape::getSpecs pure virtual function to 
receive label.
I learned how to explain the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class where abstract are usually 
used as a base class and abstract class has to contain at least one pure virtual functions which is declared by key word 
virtual and assigning this function to 0.Also abstract class can’t be used to create or modify objects and abstract class 
can’t be instantiated when concrete can be. Concrete class is self sufficient and can be used to create and modify an object 
and it doesn’t have any pure virtual functions.
