Workshop-4 part-2

In this workshop I learned how to create “Robot()” and implement default constructors to set default values by assigning 
nullptr to all char members, 0 to all digits and false to bool for my class and overload them to set values of a class by 
checking all new values for validity and initializing them in case of success.
I learned how to create destructors and dealocate memory in them I also learned that we need to add ~ to make a destructor 
so it basically looks like constructor but “~Robot()”.
I learned how to initialize class member variables by dealocating all dynamic memory first, then checking all new variables 
for validity and lastly assigning new variables to my empty class members.
I learned how to release member pointers through queries. I used speed and isDeployed query to call the fastest train and 
check the amount of deployed robots in my workshop.
