Final Project

In this project I enriched my knowledge on files and derived classes. I learned how to use ifstream and ofstream with files 
and how to use them with objects. I never tried to pointer object array and I had a lot of problems because of that especially 
at the start of ms51. These problems were differences in function calls. Using functions from Item in AidMan was strange at 
first but then I understood that all our classes are connected in a way so this seems more plausible. Display in List 
function was strange as well, I didn’t know that it is possible to send cout and cin instead of istr and ostr. In function 
Ship I didn’t get immediately that for saving linear formatted list I need to use display function with file as parameter 
and << command to file. The hardest for me was load function in Aidman. As one of the first functions for this class I was 
unfamiliar with this type of work with files and using pointer array. Easiest was Sort as it used bubble sort that copies 
addresses.
