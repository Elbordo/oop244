Workshop-6 part-2
In this workshop I learned how to define and implement multiple constructors for different situations when we need to 
assign only small part of values or single value in the constructor.
In this workshop I learned how to define and implement the rule of three for coping object to assign all values of one 
object to another, assigning values to separate object values where needed and deleting dynamic memory to deallocate.
In this workshop I learned how to read formatted data using istream to read from file or from input directly using custom 
call like “istr” instead of “cin”
In this workshop I learned how to write formatted data using ostream to write to file and print the output with custom calls 
like “ostr” instead of “cout”.
In this workshop I learned how to overload the extraction and insertion operators for I/O using iostream with them I can 
read and print output with ostream and istream functions.
