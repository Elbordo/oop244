Workshop-3 part-2

In this workshop I learned how to define a class type with private members within class 
type and instantiate objects of class type :
class a{
private:
  int b;
public:
void display() const;
}
Also I learned how to format output data with setf() and unsetf(), to change precision for decimal 
numbers cout << setprecision(2) where “2” is number of numbers after coma, to change width of space 
allowed to print message with cout.width(4) where 4 is space where our next message will fit.
I learned how to query the state of an object with simple member functions that returns data of private 
members within class double Train::getSpeed() const. Train:: to get access to private Train data, const 
because we don’t want any changes or calculations in this function.
I learned how to change the state of an object with member functions that checks constant and changes state of an 
object accordingly to them.
