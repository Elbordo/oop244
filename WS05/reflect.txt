Workshop-5 part-2

In this workshop I learned how to define and create binary operators like assignment operators with “=”, “+=”, “-=”.In 
binary operators we use current object and incoming value or reference to object. 
I learned how to define and create a type conversion operator, so every time I call current object it automatically checks 
for required type and responds with it.
I learned how to define and create a unary operator like bool operator ~() that checks for a negative value.
I learned how to define and create helper binary operator between classes like double operator+ (const Portfolio& le, const 
Portfolio& ri); This function is needed to change value between to objects.
I learned how to define and create a helper operator between primitive type and a class like  
double operator+= (double& num, const Portfolio& por); This function is needed to add double value of an object to 
double num and then return num.
